# 180bot

A Discord bot written for a private server

## Configuration
Configuration for the bot token and the quote channel to monitor is done via 
2 files named `token.conf` and `channel.conf` respectively. Simply place the 
bot token and the channel id into their respective configuration files, and 
the bot will read in the values at runtime. Make sure these are at the root of 
the bot directory!
